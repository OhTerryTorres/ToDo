# ToDo
A simple, shareable, household to-do list (in progress)

This app synchronizes a set of tasks on a remote MySQL table, so that multiple users in the same household can track the creation and completion of those tasks.

I began working on this for the sake of me and my wife. I love Apple's current Reminders app, but I just wanted add a little more seasoning.

Goal #1: Make a useable, shareable to-do list for my wife and I. (This may not even comply with all Apple standards and guidelines, as, for just the two of us, it wouldn't need to)

Goal #2: Expand the utility in goal #1 to allow a broader userbase, securing user information and allowing the creation of a task table for each new household account.
